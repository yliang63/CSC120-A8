Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
It is a maigic cat. It can only fly with magic cloak. It has very small amount stuff that it shows interests to.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I did not include others method. But I do feel like if I include others method, the program can accept more different input and be more interesting.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My fly method was edited a lot because I forgot to include return boolean sometimes. My advice will be to test everything with a main method so that there is no bug.
